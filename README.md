📌 Project Title

Predictive Analytics on Public Libraries Dataset

📖 Introduction

This project is developed as part of the INT234 – Predictive Analytics course.
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning and data analytics techniques on a real-world dataset to extract insights, identify patterns, and evaluate predictive models.

The project demonstrates concepts from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and model performance evaluation as per the course syllabus.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to public libraries, including:

Population of service area

Total library visits

Total registered borrowers

Operating expenditures

Collection per capita

County-wise distribution

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before analysis.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze the relationship between population and total library visits

Study the impact of population on registered borrowers

Compare average operating expenditure across counties

Identify top counties by total library visits

Analyze distribution of collection per capita by county

Apply K-Means clustering for segmentation

Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction

Evaluate models using regression, classification, and cross-validation

📊 Key Insights

Strong positive correlation between population and library visits

Higher population generally leads to more registered borrowers

Significant variation in operating expenditure across counties

A small number of counties contribute to a large portion of library visits

Resource distribution is uneven across regions

Clustering reveals distinct patterns in library usage

PCA reduces dimensionality while retaining meaningful variance
